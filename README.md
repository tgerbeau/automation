# GINCO/SINP Automation Project 

Python + Selenium WebDriver. 

You will find here the code to automate several critical parts of GINCO/SINP web application.

- _library.py_ contains all functions 
- _config.py_ contains credentials, urls for platforms, metadata ids, csv files used to run our tests    
- _main.py_  

## How to set up:

- [ ] Install Python (or check if already installed)  
- [ ] Install Selenium ```pip install selenium```
- [ ] Checkout the "automation" repository 
- [ ] Add your own credentials into _config.py_

## How to run automation:

- [ ] Inside automation repository, type ``` python main.py ``` or ``` python main.py countryname```
 
* If any parameter is given, "dailybuild" region will be the default region.
